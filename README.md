# gpr_depth_predict
This Jupyter Notebook (gpr_418.ipynb) implements a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model to predict material hardness distribution based on experimental data from multiple steel plates. The project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
